# MyFirstFlutterApp (%17)

I have followed Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's [Flutter Course](https://www.udemy.com/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/) on Udemy.

**Warning:** I have taken unprecedented amount of notes here and there, in the comment blocks. If you are concerned about readibility, I strongly suggest using a text editor or an IDE that is capable of collapsing them all at the opening, so that you don't have to suffer doing it yourself. 

## Some stuff that is good to know: 

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:
- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.io/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our 
[online documentation](https://flutter.io/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
