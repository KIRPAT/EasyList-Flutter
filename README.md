## EasyList (My First Flutter App)
##### Completion: %40

EasyList is a product listing app, that users can list any kind of product and give it a price. There is (currently) no back-end, and it is primarily focused on understanding the workflow of the Flutter framework. 

This is a self-study project. I am following Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's [Flutter Course](https://www.udemy.com/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/) on Udemy.

**Flutter not seeing your device on Linux?:** If you install Flutter SDK from a package manager you will probably get that error. Basically you need sudo privileges since Flutter SDK is now owned *not* by the user. There is a simple work around, type **sudo flutter doctor** on the terminal (and restart the Android Studio if you are using it). Not the best solution, but should solve the problem.  

**Warning:** I have taken unprecedented amount of notes between comment blocks. No joke, the code is virtually not readible with having them around. That's how I usually study, sorry. 

If you are concerned about readibility, I strongly suggest using a text editor or an IDE that is capable of collapsing them all at the opening, so that you don't have to suffer doing it yourself.
