## EasyList (My First Flutter App)
##### Completion: %37

EasyList is a product listing app that users can list any kind of product and give it a price. There is (currently) no back-end, and it is primarily focused on understanding the workflow of the Flutter framework. 

This is a self-study project. I am following Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's [Flutter Course](https://www.udemy.com/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/) on Udemy.

**Flutter not seeing your device on Linux?:** Flutter may require sudo access to connect to your phone, or even work properly. I type **sudo flutter doctor** on the terminal and restart the Android Studio in those cases. Not the best solution, but usually solves my problem.  

**Warning:** I have taken unprecedented amount of notes between comment blocks. No joke, the code is virtually not readible with having them around. That's how I usually study, sorry. 

If you are concerned about readibility, I strongly suggest using a text editor or an IDE that is capable of collapsing them all at the opening, so that you don't have to suffer doing it yourself.
